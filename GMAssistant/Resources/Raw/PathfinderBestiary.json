The prison is a sphere made of unmelting ice, just large enough to fit his target. The target, and any creatures sharing its space, must attempt a DC 34 Reflex save. A creature that fails becomes trapped inside the prison. If it succeeds, the creature is pushed outside the prison into a space of its choice. If the target shares its space with a gargantuan creature, the effect fails. The dome has AC 10, Hardness 20, and 40 Hit Points; and is immune to cold, critical hits, and precision damage. The prison lasts until destroyed, until Ainamuuren uses this ability to create a new prison, or until he dies.;"

Living creatures in this area take 8d6 negative damage(DC 34 basic Fortitude save). A creature that fails this save is also dazzled for 1 round (or blinded for 1 round and then dazzled for 1 round) by the darkness. The strigoi progenitor can't use Domain of Dusk for 1 minute.;Dominate [two-actions]   (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire can cast dominate (DC 34) at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.;Drink Essence [one-action]   (divine, necromancy) Requirements A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the strigoi's reach; Effect The strigoi sinks their fangs into the targeted creature to drink its blood and draw out its vital essence. This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC if the creature is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The creature becomes drained 2 and stupefied 2, and the strigoi regains 21 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Essence from a creature that's already drained or stupefied doesn't restore any HP, but increases either the creature's drained condition value or its stupefied condition value by 1 (whichever value is lesser is increased; if both values are equal, then the strigoi chooses which condition to increase the value of). A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. A victim's stupefied condition decreases by 1 per day after performing daily preparations. If the daily preparations are done in full sunlight, the stupefied condition is removed entirely.;Shadow Form [one-action]   (concentrate, divine, transmutation, shadow) The strigoi reverts to pure shadow and absorbs its body and its gear into the darkness, or it shifts back to its physical form. In shadow form, the strigoi gains a climb Speed equal to its land Speed and can move through any gap that isn't airtight. However, it can only move along solid surfaces that aren't highly reflective, not liquid or mirrored surfaces. If the surface it's on is destroyed, the strigoi returns to physical form and is stunned 1. The strigoi loses fast healing while in shadow form but can remain in shadow form indefinitely. A strigoi that is exposed to sunlight while in shadow form becomes slowed 2 and must attempt a DC 16 flat check at the end of each of its turns. If it fails this flat check, it is destroyed, the shadow vanishing with a blood-curdling wail.;"

The target must attempt a Will save. Dead creatures automatically fail this save. On a success, the target is permanently immune to Corpse Puppet. On a failure, the target is controlled by Ashen Swale. It gains the minion trait and can act as though it were alive and conscious as long as it's controlled by Ashen Swale. Controlling each target requires Ashen Swale to take an action to Command a Minion. The only actions the target can take during this time are Interact, Stride, and Strike. Ashen Swale retains control of the target for 10 minutes. This control ends immediately if the target loses the unconscious condition or the target is dealt an additional 50 damage since Ashen Swale took control (which destroys the body completely). After he has lost control of a target, that target is permanently immune to Corpse Puppet.

In time, and if she's allowed to continue her undeath, the bishop may well regain many of her spellcasting powers as a cleric of Urgathoa, but until that time she can draw upon this connection to the goddess of undeath to utter a blasphemous invocation. When she does so, shadows within a 20-foot emanation from Bishop Keppira twist, writhe, and animate before lashing out. All living creatures in the area must attempt a DC 30 Fortitude save. Bishop Keppira cannot use Blasphemous Invocation again for 1d4 rounds. Critical Success The creature is unaffected. Success The creature takes 5d6 negative damage.

This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC if the creature is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The creature becomes drained 1 and stupefied 1, and the strigoi regains 15 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Essence from a creature that's already drained or stupefied doesn't restore any HP, but increases either the creature's drained condition value or its stupefied condition value by 1 (whichever value is lesser is increased; if both values are equal, then the strigoi chooses which condition to increase the value of). A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. A victim's stupefied condition decreases by 1 per day after performing daily preparations. If the daily preparations are done in full sunlight, the stupefied condition is removed entirely.;Shadow Form [one-action]   (concentrate, divine, shadow, transmutation) The strigoi reverts to pure shadow and absorbs its body and its gear into the darkness, or it shifts back to its physical form. In shadow form, the strigoi gains a climb Speed equal to its land Speed and can move through any gap that isn't airtight. However, it can only move along solid surfaces that aren't highly reflective, not liquid or mirrored surfaces. If the surface it's on is destroyed, the strigoi returns to physical form and is stunned 1. The strigoi loses fast healing while in shadow form but can remain in shadow form indefinitely. A strigoi that is exposed to sunlight while in shadow form becomes slowed 2 and must attempt a DC 16 flat check at the end of each of its turns. If it fails this flat check, it is destroyed, the shadow vanishing with a blood-curdling wail.;"

To non-deculis, the extradimensional space looks like an ordinary area of darkness (though effects such as true seeing can see through this illusion). The deculi\u2019s infrared vision functions normally between this extradimensional space and the area outside its confines, allowing the deculi to sense what is going on around it, and its innate darkness spell also extends to the area around the shadow sanctuary. Attacks cannot be made into or from the extradimensional space.

If the area is obstructed, the deculi is shunted to the nearest available space and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 5 feet shunted. If the area overlaying the shadow sanctuary becomes illuminated by magical light, the extradimensional space can no longer be accessed and the deculi is trapped within until the area is once again in darkness.

The bleed damage can't end naturally, only ending if the creature regains at least 75 HP or regains at least 10 HP from regeneration.

It assumes the creature's Size, appearance, and voice. Wearing Skin counts as creating a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception. The ecorche's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether it's a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and the ecorche gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Wearing a skin gives the ecorche a +2 item bonus to AC and 75 temporary Hit Points. If the ecorche takes more than 50 slashing damage from a single source, the skin becomes broken. When broken, the skin no longer provides any of these benefits (any remaining temporary HP are immediately lost) but can still be used for Tear Skin.;"

Harmony in Agony's giant bat shape's fangs have a +26 attack bonus and deal 3d8+10 piercing damage.Bat The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat.

This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is drained 1 and the vampire regains 16 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points.

It can take move actions to move toward its coffin even though it's at 0 HP. While at 0 HP in this form, the vampire is unaffected by further damage. It automatically returns to its corporeal form, unconscious, if it reaches its coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first.;Melee [one-action] spear +31 [+26/+21] (thrown 20 feet), Damage 3d6+16 piercing;Melee [one-action]  fangs +29 [+25/+21] (agile), Damage 3d6+16 piercing;Melee [one-action]  claw +29 [+25/+21] (agile), Damage 3d8+16 slashing plus Grab;Ranged [one-action] spear +26 [+21/+16] (thrown 20 feet), Damage 3d6+16 piercing;Change Shape [one-action]   (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) The vampire transforms into one of its animal forms or back into its normal form. Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the aerial form and animal form spells as guidelines. Hyrune's giant bat shape's fangs have a +28 attack bonus and deal 3d12+16 piercing damageBat The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat. It gains echolocation 40 feet, a land Speed of 20 feet and a fly Speed of 30 feet, and a fangs Strike with the same attack bonus as its highest melee attack. These fangs deal the same amount of damage as the vampire's claws, but deal piercing damage rather than slashing damage.;Dominate [two-actions]   (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell (DC 36). Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.;Drink Blood [one-action]   (divine, necromancy) Requirement A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vampire's reach. Effect The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is drained 1 and Hyrune regains 22 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.;Gluttonous Gulp [two-actions]   (divine, necromancy) Hyrune dislocates his jaw to open his mouth far wider than it should, growing a thicket of additional fangs as he does. He attempts a fangs Strike and deals an additional 3d6 piercing damage on a successful hit and can attempt to Drink Blood if he as an action remaining, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus on his Athletics check to do so.;Turn to Mist [one-action]   (concentrate, divine, transmutation) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the gaseous form spell, or back to its normal form. The vampire loses fast healing while in gaseous form. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.;"

The victim is drained 1 and the jiang-shi regains HP equal to 10% of its maximum HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Draining qi from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the jiang-shi but increases the victim's drained condition value by 1.

It takes a \u20132 circumstance penalty to its Performance check or increases its current circumstance penalty by 2, whichever is worse. Failure The respondents lose the Pwnco! The Mari Lwyd demands hospitality, causing the door to unlock and open and any barriers at the door to move out of the way.

If no occupant of the building offers the Mari Lwyd alcohol or cheese before the start of its next turn and demands that it behave itself, the Mari Lwyd can use Festive Rampage at the start of its next turn. Critical Failure As failure, but due to the ineptitude of the response, the Mari Lwyd counteracts magical effects with a counteract Level of 15 and modifier of +30, and it must be offered twice as much alcohol or cheese.;"

By using a single action, which has the concentrate trait, the pleroma can cause the sphere to fly 10 feet. The sphere can move in any direction, ignoring difficult terrain, but it can\u2019t move farther than 300 feet away from the pleroma. Wherever the sphere travels, it leaves behind a 5-foot-wide path of new matter, creating either new terrain (the pleroma\u2019s choice of normal, difficult, or greater difficult terrain) or a 5-foot-square solid barrier of a single natural substance (such as clay, wood, or stone). The sphere can enter the space of a creature; when it does, the creature must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude save or be absorbed into the sphere. On a successful save, the creature is pushed to a space of the GM\u2019s choice away from the sphere. Those who fail take 20d6 positive damage (even if they are living) and are pushed away as a success. Those who critically fail, or are reduced to 0 HP by the damage from a failure, become one with the new material and can be restored only via a 10th-Level spell. A pleroma can have only one Sphere of Creation in existence at a time, and the sphere automatically vanishes in a flash of blinding light after 1d4 minutes. All creatures within 30 feet of the sphere of creation when it vanishes must succeed at a DC 43 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded.;Sphere of Oblivion [two-actions]   (incapacitation, magical) Three times per day, a pleroma can manifest a 2-foot-diameter sphere of complete and utter darkness that hovers above its right hand. It can move and control the sphere in the same manner as its Sphere of Creation. The sphere is an empty void that lasts for 1 minute before collapsing in on itself and winking out of existence. Once manifested, the sphere can be used as a ranged attack, but it blinks out of existence immediately after that attack is resolved. Any unattended object that touches the void is sucked in and completely destroyed. Larger objects (such as ships or buildings) are destroyed at a rate of one 10-foot cube per round of contact. The sphere can enter the space of a creature, with effects similar to the Sphere of Creation except that it deals negative damage (even to undead) on a failure and annihilates rather than incorporating the creature into material. Such a destroyed creature can be restored only by a 10th-Level spell.;"

This typically calls 2d4 sluagh reapers. If the queen is facing foes strong enough to threaten her, these are likely too weak to pose a threat but can assist by fetching items or getting in enemies' way.;Eat Soul [two-actions]   (necromancy, occult) The queen touches a dying creature or a creature that died within the past 1 hour with her proboscis. If the target is dying, it must attempt a DC 41 Fortitude save; on a failure, its dying value increases by 2 (3 on a critical failure). If the target is dead, the queen devours the soul. Unless the queen is destroyed, the target can't be returned to life through any means, even powerful magic such as wish.;Ghostly Swoop [one-action]   The queen sluagh becomes incorporeal until the start of their next turn, and Flies up to their fly Speed. While incorporeal, they are immune to precision damage, and have resistance 10 to all damage (except force, ghost touch, or positive); this resistance is doubled against non-magical damage. After using Ghostly Swoop, the queen sluagh can't use it again for 1d4 rounds.;Soul Theft [one-action]   (occult, necromancy, negative) Requirements The queen has a creature grabbed or restrained with her proboscis; Effect The queen devours a portion of the creature's soul and steals some of its ability. The creature takes 5d8 negative damage (DC 41 Fortitude save). The queen gains temporary HP equal to the total amount of HP the target loses, including any HP lost from being drained. Critical Success The creature is unaffected. Success The creature takes half damage and is drained 1. Failure The creature takes full damage and is drained 1 and doomed 1. The queen steals a spell slot or training. If she steals a spell from a prepared caster, she transfers the spell to herself; if she steals from a spontaneous caster, she gains a prepared spell of the appropriate Level and expends one of the creature's spell slots of that Level. If she steals training, she chooses Perception, attack modifier, or any skill. For 24 hours, she gains a +2 status bonus to that statistic and the creature takes a \u20132 status penalty. The queen can have any number of stolen abilities, but only one from each creature. Critical Failure As failure, but double damage.;"

Unless the target succeeds at a DC 36 Will save, their astral form is pulled out, causing a ghostly image of them to appear in an adjacent space of the Weaver's choosing. An astral body is immune to physical damage but affected normally by mental effects, force effects, and effects that directly target the spirit. The target remains connected to their physical body by a silver cord, which is always visible and possibly foils attempts to Hide. Separation from one's astral body takes a toll on the psyche, imposing a \u20131 status penalty to Will saves and dealing 1d6 persistent mental damage for as long as the body is separated; this increases to 3d6 if the target is ever more than 30 feet from its astral body. The target can use a single action, which has the concentrate trait, to move their astral body an amount equal to their Speed. When the target stops taking persistent mental damage from this ability, the astral body snaps back to the physical body, ending the effect. If a target is carrying silver, then the first time this ability is used on them, the ability fails and any silver they're carrying larger than a coin tarnishes\u2014while this doesn't outright destroy items like weapons or thaumaturge implements, it does prevent them from protecting against this ability more than once.;Sever Astral Threads [two-actions]   The Weaver uses a claw to cut the silver cord connecting a creature's astral and physical bodies. This deals 16d6 mental damage to any target affected by Separate Astral Body whose physical or astral body is within 10 feet of the Weaver (DC 37 basic Will save). After being targeted by this ability, the astral body slams violently back into the target's physical body, causing the target's vision to swim and blinding them until the start of their next turn unless they critically succeeded at their saving throw.;Stalker in Dreams [free-action]   (teleportation) Trigger The Weaver becomes concealed to all creatures within 60 feet or is not observed by any creatures within 60 feet; Effect The Weaver's presence on the Material Plane is connected to others' perception of him, and when that perception falters, he can skitter to a new location. The Weaver teleports to an unoccupied space within 60 feet not within line of sight of any creatures within 60 feet. If the Weaver became concealed or unobserved as part of a movement action he was taking, he can resume its movement after teleporting. A creature who Averts its Gaze from the Weaver is not observing him.;String Astral Body [one-action]   The Weaver attaches strings to a creature's astral body to move it. He forcefully moves an exposed astral body within reach of his astral silk Strike up to 20 feet, with no saving throw.;"

The shocker lizard can't use Shocking Burst again for 1 minute. Up to four shocker lizards can combine their Shocking Bursts. In this case, the lizards can delay the release of their electricity until any other shocker lizard within 30 feet completes its Shocking Burst. The combined Shocking Bursts create an emanation with the combined area from all participating shocker lizards. For each additional shocker lizard that joins the burst, the damage increases by 3d8 and the save DC increases by 1 (to a maximum of four lizards dealing 12d8 damage with a DC 21 save).;"

This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC if the creature is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The creature becomes drained 1 and stupefied 1, and the strigoi regains 13 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Essence from a creature that's already drained or stupefied doesn't restore any HP, but increases either the creature's drained condition value or its stupefied condition value by 1 (whichever value is lesser is increased; if both values are equal, then the strigoi chooses which condition to increase the value of). A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes. A victim's stupefied condition decreases by 1 per day after performing daily preparations. If the daily preparations are done in full sunlight, the stupefied condition is removed entirely.;Shadow Form [one-action]   (concentrate, divine, shadow, transmutation) The strigoi reverts to pure shadow and absorbs its body and its gear into the darkness, or it shifts back to its physical form. In shadow form, the strigoi gains a climb Speed equal to its land Speed and can move through any gap that isn't airtight. However, it can only move along solid surfaces that aren't highly reflective, not liquid or mirrored surfaces. If the surface it's on is destroyed, the strigoi returns to physical form and is stunned 1. The strigoi loses fast healing while in shadow form but can remain in shadow form indefinitely. A strigoi that is exposed to sunlight while in shadow form becomes slowed 2 and must attempt a DC 16 flat check at the end of each of its turns. If it fails this flat check, it is destroyed, the shadow vanishing with a blood-curdling wail.;"

The tallow guardian is flat-footed against the attack. If the tallow guardian takes 7 or more bludgeoning or slashing damage from an encased creature, the creature wrenches itself free.

It automatically returns to its corporeal form, unconscious, if it reaches its coffin or after 2 hours, whichever comes first.;Melee [one-action]  claw +18 [+14/+10] (agile), Damage 2d8+9 slashing plus Grab;Change Shape [one-action]   (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) Giant bat with fangs +19 for 2d8+9 piercing.;Dominate [two-actions]   (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental, visual) The vampire can cast dominate (DC 26) at will as a divine innate spell. Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.;Drain Bonded Item [free-action]   (arcane, wizard) Frequency Once per day. Requirements The vampire hasn\u2019t acted yet on this turn. Effect The vampire expends the power stored in its signet ring. This gives the vampire the ability to cast one prepared spell it had already previously cast today, without spending a spell slot. The vampire must still Cast the Spell and meet the spell\u2019s other requirements.;Drink Blood [one-action]   (divine, necromancy) Requirement A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vampire's reach. Effect The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is drained 2 and the vampire regains 10 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so. A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.;Turn to Mist [one-action]   (concentrate, divine, transmutation) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the gaseous form spell, or back to its normal form. The vampire loses fast healing while in gaseous form. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.;"

If the target has a weakness to cold iron, Taviah gains a +2 circumstance bonus to this check.

It must return to this location once per week and bury itself in the earth for 24 hours, during which time it is paralyzed and can be beheaded. If it is unable to return to this site, it is reduced to 0 Hit Points and attempts to use Feral Corruption; if this host animal can't return to the burial site before the possession effect ends, the vrykolakas is destroyed and the animal host returns to normal.Vulnerable to Decapitation A vrykolakas that is beheaded can't use its Feral Possession, and a beheaded corpse cannot rise as a vrykolakas.Feral Possession  [free-action]  (curse, divine, incapacitation, mental, necromancy, possession Trigger The vrykolakas is reduced to 0 Hit Points, and an animal is within 100 feet) Effect Unlike most other undead, a vrykolakas isn't destroyed when it reaches 0 HP. Instead, it attempts to cast its spirit into an animal within 100 feet, which must attempt a Will save (DC 33). On a failure, the animal is possessed. This has the effects of the possession spell, but it lasts a number of days equal to the vrykolakas's Level. This possession can't be counteracted with magic (though remove curse works against it normally).;Melee [one-action]  fangs +27 [+22/+17], Damage 3d10+17 piercing plus Drink Blood;Melee [one-action]  claw +27 [+23/+19] (agile), Damage 3d6+17 slashing;Change Shape [one-action]   (concentrate, divine, polymorph, transmutation) A vrykolakas ancient can transform into a form resembling the body it had in life, with the effects of humanoid form but with unlimited duration. It loses its fangs and claw Strikes but gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Deception checks to Impersonate in this form.;Dominate Animal [one-action]   (divine, enchantment, incapacitation, mental) DC 33, The vrykolakas can cast dominate at will as a divine innate spell that affects only animals. A creature that succeeds is immune to that vrykolakas's Dominate Animal for 24 hours. Destroying the vrykolakas ends the effect, but reducing it to 0 HP does not. A dominated animal takes a \u20134 circumstance penalty to saving throws against the vrykolakas's Feral Possession.;Drink Blood [one-action]   (divine, necromancy) Requirements The vrykolakas' last action was a successful fangs Strike; Effect The vrykolakas sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the creature's Fortitude DC. On a success, the creature becomes drained 2, and the vrykolakas regains 25 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire, but it increases the creature's drained condition value by 1. A vrykolakas can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so. The target creature's drained condition value decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a successful DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drained value by 1 after 10 minutes.;Rend [one-action]   claw;Sanguine Mauling [one-action] Requirements The vrykolakas ancient's last action was to Drink Blood; Effect The vrykolakas ancient makes two claw Strikes. Both count toward its multiple attack penalty, but the penalty increases only after it makes both attacks. If it hits with both claws, the target takes 1d6 persistent bleed damage.;Steal Breath [two-actions]   (manipulate) Requirements The vrykolakas ancient is adjacent to an unconscious creature; Effect The vrykolakas ancient steals the creature's breath. The unconscious creature begins suffocating, can't be awakened for 1 round, and must attempt a DC 33 Fortitude save. If a creature is targeted with this ability in consecutive rounds, the save DC decreases by 2 each round after the first. Critical Success The target immediately awakens and is then temporarily immune to Steal Breath for 24 hours. Success The target is unaffected. Failure The target takes 1d10 damage. Critical Failure The target is reduced to 0 HP and becomes dying 1.;"

Most vampires can turn into a bat, but some can turn into a different creature, such as a rat or a wolf. Use the options in the aerial form and animal form spells as guidelines. Weeping Jack's bat form's fangs strike have a +25 attack bonus and deal 2d8+13 piercing damage.Bat The vampire changes into a bat swarm or giant bat.

Casting it requires staring into the target's eyes, giving the spell the visual trait. A creature that succeeds is temporarily immune to that vampire's Dominate for 24 hours. Fully destroying the vampire ends the domination, but merely reducing the vampire to 0 HP is insufficient to break the spell.;Drink Blood [one-action]   (divine, necromancy) Requirement A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vampire's reach. Effect The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is drained 1 and Weeping Jack regains 16 HP, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so.A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes.;Turn to Mist [one-action]   (concentrate, divine, transmutation) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the gaseous form spell, or back to its normal form. The vampire loses fast healing while in gaseous form. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.;"

Zinogyvaz can turn into a hunting spider or spider swarm only, and she keeps her fangs and web Strikes in either form.;Drink Blood [one-action]   (divine, necromancy) Requirement A grabbed, paralyzed, restrained, unconscious, or willing creature is within the vampire's reach. Effect The vampire sinks its fangs into that creature to drink its blood. This requires an Athletics check against the victim's Fortitude DC if the victim is grabbed and is automatic for any of the other conditions. The victim is drained 1 and Zinogyvaz regains 24 Hit Points, gaining any excess HP as temporary Hit Points. Drinking Blood from a creature that's already drained doesn't restore any HP to the vampire but increases the victim's drain value by 1. A vampire can also consume blood that's been emptied into a vessel for sustenance, but it gains no HP from doing so. A victim's drained condition decreases by 1 per week. A blood transfusion, which requires a DC 20 Medicine check and sufficient blood or a blood donor, reduces the drain by 1 after 10 minutes. When Drinking Blood, Zinogyvaz may inject the victim with vampire drider venom.;Turn to Mist [one-action]   (concentrate, divine, transmutation) The vampire turns into a cloud of vapor, as the gaseous form spell, or back to its normal form. The vampire loses fast healing while in gaseous form. The vampire can remain in this form indefinitely.;"
